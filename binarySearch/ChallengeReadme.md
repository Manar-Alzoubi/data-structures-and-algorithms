## Approach & Efficiency
since the array is sorted, the approach is to divide the array into two halfs , and determine  the element is in which half, then divide the half of array in which the element is into two halfs and compare to the middle element ,if the element is greater than the middle search on the greater half else search in the smaller half and repeate until you find the element , if it is not exist return -1
