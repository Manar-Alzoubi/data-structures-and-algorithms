# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

* a stack implemented and stack methods are : 
  * peek()
  * push()
  * pop()
  * isEmpty
*a queue implemented and queue methods are :
  * enqueue()
  * dequeue()
  * peek()
  * isEmpty

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
in this code an implementation of stack and queue are done and some methodes implemented to do some operations and deal with stack and queue

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The approach I used is to declare node class and then declaring Stack class and Queue class and methods from each class 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

     a stack methods are : 
        * peek(): is to show the element on top of stack
        * push() : to add new element on the top of stack 
        * pop() : removes element from top of stack 
        * isEmpty : enshure if stack is empty or not

        a Queue methods are : 
        * peek(): is to show the element on top of stack
        * enqueue() : to add new element on the top of stack 
        * dequeue() : removes element from top of stack 
        * isEmpty : enshure if stack is empty or not
